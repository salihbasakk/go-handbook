### Usage

``` go run {{ filename }} ```

To run the program, put the code in hello-world.go and use go run.

``` go run hello-world.go ```

Prints the terminal "Hello world".

Sometimes weâ€™ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using go build.

``` go build hello-world.go ```

``` ls ```

Outputs: hello-world hello-world.go

Then we can then execute the built binary directly. 

``` ./hello-world ```
